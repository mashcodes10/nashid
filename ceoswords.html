  Hello brother <span class="type" style="--n:100000"><strong>
  It has been 3 years since we know each other. I know that it is not that much of time but remember what I said, " Don't be sad because we didn't meet earlier in life; instead, rejoice because we will be always brothers. I remember the day when everybody was busy planning their seats and I was alone thinking that I will not plan my seat. Not even my close friends were there. Then there was the only person in the class who wanted to seat in front of me. That was the time when our friendship started. Who knew that a stupid seat plan would be the start of a wonderful friendship? Yes, we don't know what is best for us. Allah always plans the best for us. I never expected to meet you at this stage of my life. I couldn't describe our friendship in words because words aren't that powerful. Before meeting you, I had no idea what the term "friend" meant. You were always there in my every difficulty. I was a person who always loved to keep his life secret. But I shared my every problem with you and things started to get easier from then. Covid is a disgrace for the whole of humanity but it helped me to identify who will always be by my side and who will not. I lost many so-called friends during this time. Does it matter? No, it doesn't. Because I found the true ones. We have a lot of similarities. Nobody in this class believed me as much as you did. Every day of the college test seemed like a living torment. I struggled a lot in those days. But then there was you who always believed in that struggling boy, who used to inspire me in my every task. I always had the confusion that I couldn't do this task reminiscing my old memories. You were there to motivate me to start those tasks. I've always had a sour attitude toward my studies. Despite the difficulties posed by my environment, you provided me with the ideal teacher. My academics piqued my attention, and we began collaborating to strengthen our academics. When I came back from the year-long gap you helped me to start my studies. My preparation was the weakest in the class, but you somehow assisted me to get through these. Guard was standing right behind you and still, you managed to pass the question. You had no fear in helping me. Even if  I write a thousand essays I couldn't describe what you did to help me. The only thing you want from me is that I become successful in my life. When I myself had not the belief that I would become CEO one day, you believed in me. I don't know whether I will be CEO or not but I am sure that I will not forget someone who believed. I know that it is different now since we are not on the same paths. We may not discuss our daily tasks and stuff but that doesn't change the fact that we are brothers. I wish that we both succeed in our respective paths. No matter where we end up our brotherhood will always be the same. Even if we are in two parts of the world we will still know what are we doing. I hope that we will achieve success together and we will remember these days with a big smile on our faces. And remember Uzi is mine you mf. -ceo
